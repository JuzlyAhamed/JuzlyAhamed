### “In a time of drastic change it is the learners who inherit the future. The learned usually find themselves equipped to live in a world that no longer exists.” -Eric Hoffer

My life thumbnail sketch :
<ul style="none">
<li> 🔭 I’m currently working on Breezebee, and an undergratuate of University of Colombo School of Computing. </li>
<li> 📚 What do I beleive? Jack of all, Master of some. </li>
<li> 🌱 I’m currently learning to manage my time, and be productive. </li>
<li> 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any idea that impresses me. </li>
<li> 💬 Ask me about Web Development,Design, Marketing, Sales, Community Building. </li>
<li> 📫 How to reach me: Innovative Coder  </li>
<li> ⚡ Fun fact: I love Irish Coffee ☕ </li>
</ul>

I strongly believe that constant learning is a part of our journey, and if at some point one stops the process, that person is out of the game. My constant learning in both horizontal and vertical dimensions has landed me some of the best opportunities I could have ever dreamt of, in the last few years. Coming from a strong tech background, spending most of my time learning and teaching code, I found another vertical of mine which was to do marketing and become an influencer.
Social media is a tool you can use to leverage your digital identity, an identity on which only you have the control. I am a product of digital identity and strongly believe in creating an online presence.
