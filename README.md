I strongly believe that constant learning is a part of our journey, and if at some point one stops the process, that person is out of the game. My constant learning in both horizontal and vertical dimensions has landed me some of the best opportunities I could have ever dreamt of, in the last few years. Coming from a strong tech background, spending most of my time learning and teaching code, I found another vertical of mine which was to do marketing and become an influencer.
Social media is a tool you can use to leverage your digital identity, an identity on which only you have the control. I am a product of digital identity and strongly believe in creating an online presence.
